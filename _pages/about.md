Welcome to my website!

I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at the Institute for Finance and Banking at Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich, with my dissertation focusing on Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods applied on financial textual data. My academic foundation is in mathematics, where I achieved a Master's degree.

My passion lies in the field of NLP, with a keen interest in exploring transformer based models like BERT or Large Language Models in general. This enthusiasm has led me to spearhead significant projects, such as pre-training German, finance-specific BERT models or the creation of a German, finance-specific benchmark for language models.
