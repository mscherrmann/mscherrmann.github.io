Welcome to my website!

Currently, I am employed as a Machine Learning Engineer at neoshare AG, a company that has developed an ecosystem for the implementation and management of project and real estate financing.

I completed my Ph.D. at the Institute for Finance and Banking at Ludwig Maximilian University (LMU) in Munich, where my dissertation concentrated on applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to financial textual data. My academic background is rooted in financial mathematics, culminating in a Master's degree.

My passion lies in the field of NLP, with a keen interest in exploring transformer based models like BERT or Large Language Models in general. This enthusiasm has led me to spearhead significant projects, such as pre-training German, finance-specific BERT models or the creation of a German, finance-specific benchmark for language models.
